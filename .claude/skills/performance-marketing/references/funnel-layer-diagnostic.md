# Funnel-Layer Diagnostic — Template + Trigger

The standard read for a live paid campaign. It walks the funnel **top to bottom by layer**, marks each layer 🟢/🟡/🔴, names the **one layer that is breaking**, and gates every action on that read. This is the canonical format for the **Live Monitoring** section of a campaign build doc (the `00 - …Campaign…md` hub in the offer's campaign folder).

It exists so campaign reads are consistent and complete instead of memory-dependent. Source spec: the platform playbook's §9 **Metric Diagnosis Table** (e.g. the Meta Ads Playbook §9).

## WHEN TO RUN IT (the trigger)

Generate or update a diagnostic block **at every scheduled read** and **before any kill/scale decision**:

- **Day 1** (or first morning after launch): confirm delivery + spend pacing only — too early for performance reads (see Meta Ads Playbook 72-hour rule).
- **Day 3** — first real read once the algorithm has learning data.
- **Day 5, Day 7, Day 12** — and at any cadence the campaign's `## Next Actions` schedules.
- **Any time a kill or scale rule is being considered** — the decision must be gated on a fresh diagnostic, not a glance at ROAS.

Each run is **added newest-on-top** in the Live Monitoring section (most recent diagnostic first), so the history reads in reverse chronological order. Never overwrite a prior day's diagnostic, because together they are the record of how the campaign was read over time.

**Live Monitoring is the hub's designated time-series log, and the rest of the hub is current-state.** Dated diagnostic blocks belong only in Live Monitoring (and one-line rows in the Decision Log). After each read, rewrite the hub's other affected sections in place (actuals, risk callouts, budget and pacing plan, status line) so they match the latest diagnostic. Do not leave an earlier claim standing with a dated note beneath it.

**Completeness rule:** a campaign that has passed a scheduled read date with no diagnostic logged is incomplete — fill it from the Meta/platform CSV export + the Selar (or platform) sales export. A campaign that is younger than its first scheduled read (e.g. Day 1) legitimately has only the delivery/pacing pre-flight check, not a full table — that is not "missing," it's pre-first-read.

The trigger lives in the campaign-build cadence (the hub's `## Next Actions` schedules the read dates) — wire the read task there so the diagnostic is invoked, not remembered.

## READING ORDER (top to bottom; stop at the first break)

Read the layers in this order and stop diagnosing downstream once you find the break — everything below a broken layer is downstream noise until the break is fixed:

**Delivery → CPM → Creative → Audience → Landing Page → Offer → Full-funnel (CPA/ROAS)**

- **Delivery / pre-flight first** — if the ad is off/rejected/under-pacing, nothing else matters.
- **CPM is the first performance metric** read after pre-flight. It's the rawest signal of whether the platform thinks the ad is worth showing; a high CPM inflates every cost beneath it, so an unaddressed CPM problem makes everything downstream look worse than it is.
- **Landing-page layer = destination OR offer.** Low CVR with healthy CTR means people clicked but didn't buy. Audit the page first (message-match, mobile speed, CTA clarity). If the page is sound, the **offer or price is the leak** — clicks-without-conversions is the classic offer-problem signal (see Meta Ads Conversion Playbook Reasons 1-2).
- **Selar (or platform sales backend) is truth.** Meta/TikTok undercount; always cross-check attributed purchases against the sales export and report the capture rate. Never assume the processor — it may be Selar, Paystack, Flutterwave, Stripe, Gumroad, or a manual transfer log.
- **Webinar / multi-stage funnels split the destination layer into three.** For a webinar funnel (ad → registration → live/replay → checkout) the platform optimizes for the Lead (registration) and cannot see the sale at all. Insert two breakpoints between the Landing-page layer and the Full-funnel layer: **Registration → Show-up** (attendance rate, from the webinar room / Sheet) and **Show-up → Purchase** (from the backend export). CPL is the only ad-side number; everything past registration is read downstream, not from the platform. A healthy CPL with weak full-funnel ROAS almost always breaks at Show-up→Purchase — the fix is the webinar and the close, not the campaign.

---

## REPORT COLUMN SETUP (do this once, before you read anything)

The diagnostic only works if Ads Manager shows the right columns. Build a saved custom column set once and reuse it for every read so the numbers are always comparable. In Meta Ads Manager: **Columns → Customise Columns**, add the set below, tick **Save as preset**, name it "MIA Read-the-Funnel".

**The MIA Meta column set (in funnel-read order):** delivery · amount spent · budget · results · purchases · purchase ROAS · adds to cart · leads · cost per result · reach · impressions · CPM · hook rate · hold rate · thruplay completion rate · frequency · results ROAS · clicks (all) · CTR · quality ranking · landing page views · cost per landing page view.

- **Hook rate, hold rate, and ThruPlay completion usually aren't default columns** — add them as **custom metrics** (Customise Columns → Create Custom Metric): hook rate = 3-second video plays ÷ impressions; hold rate = 15-second (or ThruPlay) plays ÷ 3-second plays; ThruPlay completion = 100% plays ÷ ThruPlays.
- **Quality ranking** is only in the campaign-level view, not the placement/age breakdown exports.
- Use the same saved set for every scheduled read (Day 3/5/7/12) and for the weekly report.

## READING THE BREAKDOWNS (placement, age, gender)

The funnel-layer read tells you **which ad or ad set** is breaking. The delivery breakdowns tell you **where inside a working ad set** spend is wasted or won. Pull them from the same saved column set, one breakdown at a time (by placement, by age, by gender), at the Day 5/7/12 reads once each segment has spent about 1× target CPA. Cross-check any demographic against the Selar/sales export before cutting — the platform undercounts, so a segment that looks dead can be the one actually buying.

- **Placement.** Advantage+ Placements spreads budget across every placement. On low-volume purchase/message campaigns, after ~3 days, if spend is leaking into placements with no results (often Reels, Stories, Audience Network), switch to manual placements and keep the converters (Instagram Feed in-app tends to win on low volume). Scale by concentrating budget on the winning placement.
- **Age.** Advantage+ Audience overrides the age cap, so an age limit only binds with Advantage+ Audience off or in a duplicated ad set. Tighten to the converting bands after enough spend.
- **Gender.** Narrow only after enough spend and only when the Selar record agrees.
- Editing placement, age, or gender on a live ad set can reset learning — duplicate with the tighter targeting for significant changes rather than editing the winner.

Quality Ranking is not available in the placement/age breakdown exports (see the column-setup note above); pull it from the main campaign view.

## THE TEMPLATE (copy, fill, append newest-on-top)

```markdown
### Funnel-Layer Diagnostic — Day [N] ([YYYY-MM-DD])

Per Meta Ads Playbook §9 Metric Diagnosis Table.

**Snapshot date:** [YYYY-MM-DD] ([Day N cumulative / window])

**Source:** [path to platform CSV export] + [Selar/sales export, window]

**Campaign totals:** [spend] / [attributed purchases] / [LPVs] / [ATCs] / [Leads] / [impressions] / [reach] across [N] ads. Pacing: [spend/day] vs [planned] ([%]).

| Layer | Metric | Reading | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-flight | Delivery Status | [Active/…] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | |
| Pre-flight | Spend vs. Planned | [x/day vs planned] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | |
| Auction cost | **CPM (read first)** | [value vs NG/diaspora target] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | high CPM inflates everything downstream |
| Creative (first 2s) | Hook Rate (3s views ÷ impressions) | [%] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | target 20%+ NG / 25%+ diaspora; low = first 1-2s isn't stopping the scroll |
| Creative (mid) | Hold Rate (15s views ÷ 3s views) | [%] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | target 15%+ NG / 20%+ diaspora; low = the middle loses people, rewrite it |
| Creative (end) | ThruPlay Completion (100% plays ÷ ThruPlays) | [%] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | target 25%+ (15s) / 15%+ (30s) / 8%+ (60s); low = weak ending, drags, or too long |
| Creative + Offer match | CTR (link) | [%] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | |
| Creative × Audience | CPC (link) | [value] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | |
| Audience saturation | Frequency | [value] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | cold <2.0, RT <4.0 |
| Landing page | CVR (post-click) | [%] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | 2-5%+ target; if low + CTR healthy → destination OR offer |
| Full funnel | True CPA (Selar-corrected) | [value] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | |
| Full funnel | True ROAS (Selar) | [value] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | ≥2x floor, 3x+ healthy |
| Creative algorithmic | Quality Ranking | [Above/Avg/Below] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | Below = rebuild creative, not placement |

**[Sales backend] truth cross-check ([window]):**

| Source | Sales | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Selar channel, full window] | [n] | |
| [platform]-attributed | [n] | |
| Capture rate | [%] | attributed / Selar |

**Layer breaking right now:**

1. [Name the broken layer + the evidence. Stop here if upstream is the break.]

**Action gated on this read:**

1. [Specific action tied to the broken layer — pause / refresh / reallocate / scale, with the threshold that justifies it.]
2. [Next scheduled read + what leading indicator confirms or kills the hypothesis.]
```

Add a **per-ad incremental table** (spend/purchases between the last read and this one → marginal CPA) whenever a campaign has multiple ads and you need to see which ad is decaying — that marginal read catches efficiency decay a cumulative read hides.

## STATUS KEY

- 🟢 in healthy range for the geo (NG vs diaspora thresholds differ — see the platform playbook §9).
- 🟡 off-threshold but not yet actionable / trending wrong.
- 🔴 broken — this layer gates the action.
